To compile the library do:

cmake .
make
sudo make install

To customize the installation prefix use
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local


*** TRANSCODE plugins ***

You need to have the transcode sources installed. The best
choice it to download the same version you have in your distribution.
Youi don't need to compile transcode itself.
Download from http://tcforge.berlios.de/ or

Then you need to adapt the transcode/CMakeLists.txt and change
 the variable
> set(TRANSCODE_ROOT path/to/transcode)

cd transcode/cmake
make
. install.sh

*** FFMPEG ***

You need to configure ffmpeg with --enable-vidstab
